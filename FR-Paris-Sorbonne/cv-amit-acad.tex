\section{Education}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ph.D., Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London (thesis pending)
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Thesis: Multiscale design, robust optimisation and control of fuel cell energy systems.
\item Committee: Efstratios Pistikopoulos, Nilay Shah, Anthony Kucernak, Constantinos Pantelides%, Morten Hovd
\item This work developed a novel design, system integration and control automation framework using multi-parametric programming and robust optimisation techniques, two prominent approaches to decision making under uncertainty.  Research carried out contributed to the experimental understanding of fuel cell phenomena and theoretical advancement of multi-parametric model predictive control. From the practical standpoint, the focus was to develop efficient fuel cell controllers. Towards that goal this work developed two novel experimental test facilities. The first facility helps understand inner workings of an operating polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell by developing in situ experimental maps of spatiotemporally resolved temperature distributions using a combined array of 140 temperature sensors placed on both anode and cathode surfaces where the reaction occurs. These results were combined with the pressure profiles using reactant imaging data and water distributions using neutron tomography. This work enables to validate the high fidelity mathematical models of the fuel cell system and underlined subsystem. The second facility is a state-of-the-art fully automated, fully integrated fuel cell power plant built to develop, deploy and demonstrate advanced control automation technologies and the proposed system integration framework. This pilot plant was as one of the smart manufacturing testbeds.
\end{itemize}
\item M.S., Chemical Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Thesis: Tuning of model predictive controllers
  \item Committee: Donald Chmielewski, Geoffrey Williamson, Satish Parulekar, Fouad Teymour
  \item This work presents a systematic approach for the tuning of linear model predictive controllers based on an economic interpretation of the computationally attractive covariance constrained control problem. Work addressed Kalman's long standing question of inverse optimal control. Additionally, work contributed to the sensor/actuator hardware selection and placement problem. This work has been incorporated in the book titled `Smart process plants: software and hardware solutions for accurate data and profitable operations'.

\section*{Biography}
%Amit completed his doctoral studies in chemical engineering from Imperial College London and revising his thesis.
Amit is a subject matter expert on smart manufacturing for the process industry. His research focuses on the development of smart manufacturing platform, products, and technology solutions. He studied chemical engineering at Imperial College, Illinois Institute of Technology and Maharashtra Institute of Technology. He worked as an Industrial Automation Consultant with RasGas Qatar before joining Invensys as a Software Technology Developer for the Advanced Process Control product 'Connoisseur{\texttrademark}â. In academia, he worked as an Assistant Professor of Instrumentation and Control at the College of Engineering Pune. His work underpins enabling technologies for smart manufacturing that focuses on the development of economically and environmentally conscious process design, global optimisation and robust control theory. His seminal contributions on the controller tuning and economic value of control strategies carried out in collaboration with Professor Donald J. Chmielewski has been incorporated in the book titled: 'Smart Process Plants: Software and Hardware Solutions for Accurate Data and Profitable Operationsâ. His contributions on the grand unification of the industrial automation hierarchy resulted in the development of a state-of-the-art multi-scale fuel cell test platform. He has published numerous scholarly publications and has received several funding grants. He is a recipient of the Excellence in Teaching award at the Illinois Institute of Technology and listed in Marquis Who's who in Science and Engineering. He is a winner of the IChemE Journal's best reviewers award. Currently he is working as an independent research consultant and data analyst.
