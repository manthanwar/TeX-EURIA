  abstract = {In situ and ex situ spatially-resolved techniques are employed to investigate reactant distribution and its impacts in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell. Temperature distribution data provides further evidence for secondary flows inferred from reactant imaging data, highlighting the contribution of convection in heat as well as reactant distribution. Water build-up from neutron tomography is linked to component degradation, matching the pattern seen in the reactant distribution and thus suggesting that high, non-uniform local current densities shape degradation patterns in fuel cells. The correlations shown between different techniques confirm the use of the versatile reactant imaging technique, which is used to compare commonly used flow field designs. Among serpentine-type designs, the single serpentine is superior in both equivalent current density and reactant distribution, showing large contributions from convective flow. On the other hand, the interdigitated design is shown to produce larger equivalent current densities, while showing a somewhat poorer reactant distribution. Considering the correlations drawn between the techniques, this suggests that the interdigitated design compromises durability in favour of power output. The results highlight how established techniques provide a robust background for the use of a new and flexible imaging technique toward designing advanced flow fields for practical fuel cell applications.}

  abstract  = {In this work we propose a new formulation of the stochastic based minimum back-off operating point selection problem. It is shown that this formulation has a convex/reverse-convex form and is thus readily solved globally via a branch and bound search scheme. The formulation is then extended to the partial state information case as well as the discrete-time framework. The formulation is unique in that the controller feedback gain is not specified a priori but rather is to be determined by the proposed optimization. It is further shown that the obtained feedback gain is such that an LQR inverse optimal feedback is guaranteed to exist within the set of feasible feedback	gains. A postprocessing procedure is proposed for the synthesis of such a feedback as well as the corresponding LQR objective function weights. This connection between the economics of operating point selection and the dynamics of predictive controller tuning (i.e., the selection of objective function weighs) is expected to significantly enhance the synergy of modern hierarchial control structures. The proposed method is illustrated, first through a simple mass-spring-damper example and then via a 3 input, 4 state furnace/reactor system. <br> In this work we propose a new formulation of the stochastic based minimum back-off operating point selection problem.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a systematic tuning approach for linear model predictive controllers based on the computationally attractive minimum variance covariance constrained control (MVC3) problem. Unfortunately, the linear feedback policy generated by the MVC3 problem is incompatible with the algorithmic framework of predictive control, in which the primary tuning vehicle is the selection of objective function weights. The main result of this paper is to show that all linear feedbacks generated by the MVC3 problem exhibit the property of inverse optimality with respect to an appropriately defined linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. Thus, the proposed tuning scheme is a two-step procedure: application of the MVC3 problem to achieve tuning objectives, followed by application of inverse optimality to determine the predictive control weights from the MVC3-generated linear feedback.},

This formulation considers capital cost in the objective function and highlights the importance of magnitude limits on both input and output signals through variance bounding constraints on each. Thus,	the proposed optimization problem is aimed at finding the set of minimum cost actuator arrays such that there exists a linear feedback for which all closed-loop signals will satisfy their magnitude limits. The original formulation of this problem results in a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). However, through an LMI based transformation we exactly convert the problem into a computationally advantageous Mixed Integer Convex Program (MICP). Finally, the design method is applied to an example of actuator placement in a non-isothermal tubular reactor.},
