This work focuses on creating a cloud infrastructure that enables the acquisition, transformation, contextualisation, processing, analysis, and reuse of cultural heritage information through a set of intelligent algorithms and easy-to-configure tools converted into marketplace solutions and services in a secure, open, collaborative, interoperable, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective manner. Our solution will facilitate the digital renaissance through a high-impact cloud ecosystem that integrates end-to-end research, innovation, education, and promotion activities using enabling technologies for art and 2D objects, architecture and 3D objects, and intangible cultural heritage in the form of old crafts, traditions, and agricultural practices. Developed in close collaboration with end-users of ECCCH, our intelligent tools and solutions will be rigorously tested and valorise before making them public through our open marketplace for cultural heritage.
