\textbf{Objectives}\\
The aim of this WP is to develop a 3D vision, 3D modelling and digital twinning algorithms and apply them to the digitalisation of small object. The work will be carried out in the following steps: 1. A small object for digitalization will be identified with the help of National Museum of Agriculture, Museum of Amelia, and the Weingreen Museum. 2. The object will be scanned using the high precision as well as low-precision, low-cost scanning techniques. 3. Different 2D modelling and 3D twinning algorithm will be developed 4. Finally, the application will be demonstrated by carrying out the above steps using the cloud-enabled applications for 3D vision
